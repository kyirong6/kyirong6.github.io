I'm currently an undergraduate student at [SFU](https://www.sfu.ca) finishing a BSc in both **Computer Science** and **Statistics**. 

I enjoy brainstorming and experimenting in order to build potential solutions to challenging problems.

Moreover, I'm a musician who's curious about developing new ways to create, interact, and analyze music with the aid of machine learning. Check out some music I'm writing at my [soundloud](https://soundcloud.com/choenden-kyirong) or the songs I've been listening to on my [spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/12182139320?si=17bed67a334541f4).

For Spring 2022, I will be joining [Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/ca/) at their [R&D Institute](https://research.samsung.com/srca) as a Data Analyst Intern.
<!---Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern for [WorkSafeBC](https://www.worksafebc.com/en) on the Innovation Team. Moreover, I also work as a Data Scientist and Software Developer for [BetterCart](https://bettercart.ca/home). Previously, I worked in the Data Analytics division of the Strategic Policy Branch at the [CBSA](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html) as a Junior Data Scientist Intern.
I'm deeply passionate about music and the applications of AI to audio/music such as music information retrieval and composition. Moreover, I previously studied Jazz Performance for Trombone at the [University of Toronto](https://music.utoronto.ca/index.php). If I'm not on my computer, you'll most likely find me on the basketball court, soccer pitch, or playing/listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5nnUhG5qJfB8Pzs7Vodlii?si=v3lE_DKHSBaygH-eEBzpBQ).-->
