I'm currently an undergraduate student at [SFU](https://www.sfu.ca) finishing a BSc in both **Computer Science** and **Statistics**. At the moment, I mentor 1st or 2nd year undergraduates Statistics students through [SASSA](http://www.sfu.ca/sassa/). I will be joining [BetterCart](https://bettercart.ca/home), a Canadian Startup, as a Data Scientist and Software Development Intern for Winter 2021. Previously, I worked in the Data Analytics division of the Strategic Policy Branch at the [CBSA](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html) as a Junior Data Scientist Intern.
