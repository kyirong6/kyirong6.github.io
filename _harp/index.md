I'm currently an undergraduate student at [SFU](https://www.sfu.ca) finishing a BSc in both **Computer Science** and **Statistics**. I currently work as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern for [WorkSafeBC](https://www.worksafebc.com/en) on the Innovation Team. Moreover, I also work as a Data Scientist and Software Developer for [BetterCart](https://bettercart.ca/home). Previously, I worked in the Data Analytics division of the Strategic Policy Branch at the [CBSA](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html) as a Junior Data Scientist Intern.

I'm deeply passionate about music and the applications of AI to audio/music such as music information retrieval and composition. Moreover, I previously studied Jazz Performance for Trombone at the [University of Toronto](https://music.utoronto.ca/index.php). If I'm not on my computer, you'll most likely find me on the basketball court, soccer pitch, or playing/listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5nnUhG5qJfB8Pzs7Vodlii?si=v3lE_DKHSBaygH-eEBzpBQ).
