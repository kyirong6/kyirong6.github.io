Hello! I'm Choenden. I'm a machine learning engineer at BetterCart Analytics. I work on our ML/Data platform which encompasses a wide array of tasks such as building end-to-end ML workflows, developing data engineering pipelines, setting up infrastructure, and productionizing ML/data services. Previously, I was working at Samsung Research Canada's [R&D Institute](https://research.samsung.com/srca) as a Data Engineering Intern. 

I'm also a jazz trombinist playing in a variety of groups/settings that centers around improvisation as a means to express ones self musically. If interested, check out some music I'm -very slowly- writing on my [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/choenden-kyirong), the artists that influence me on my [spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/12182139320?si=17bed67a334541f4), or come say "hey!" at any upcoming [shows](https://linktr.ee/ckyirong) I'm playing at with some very talented and inspiring friends.

This site is currently a work in progress....Feel free to check out my twitter in the meantime. I like to tweet about music, computer science, sports, and other things!
