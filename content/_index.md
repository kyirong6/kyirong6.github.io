I'm currently doing my MSc in Sound and Music Computing at Universitat Pompeu Fabra within the [Music Technology Group](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg). I'm interested in Computational Music, Human-Centered AI, Music Information Retrieval, Music Structure, and Improvisation.

At BetterCart Analytics, I work as a Machine Learning Engineer on the ML/Data platform where I lead Machine Learning features and Information Retrieval systems that includes over 60,000,000 new records per week across 6,000+ stores and 100+ retailers.

I'm also a jazz trombonist playing in a variety of groups/settings that centers around improvisation. If interested, check out some music I'm -very slowly- writing on my [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/choenden-kyirong), the artists that influence me on my [spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/12182139320?si=17bed67a334541f4), or come say "hey" at any upcoming [shows](https://linktr.ee/ckyirong) I'm playing with some very talented and inspiring friends.

This site is currently a work in progress...Feel free to check out my twitter in the meantime. I like to tweet about music, computer science, sports, and other things.
